# Twitter Clone in React

The purpose of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of React. By using something that exists, I can remove a large part of the building process. I am just copying what already exists and concentrating on code and architecture.

This entire thing is a work in progress and could be pretty gnarly.

All opinions and suggestions are welcome!

## Installing

Install and run:

* Clone the repo `git clone git@github.com:ScottRadcliff/twitter-clone.git`
